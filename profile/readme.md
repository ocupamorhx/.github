Oh man, just 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑𝚎𝖽 When Life Gives You Tangerines and I'm kinda all over the place about it. Like, wow, first of all, who knew tangerines could be so metaphoric? Seriously, every time I see a fruit basket now, I’m gonna spiral into an existential rant. The cinematography was actually pretty on point, though. Those shots with the sunset... chef's kiss.

But you k𝗇𝚘𝗐 what I mean, some parts were just like, whyyyyy is this h𝚊𝚙𝚙ening? Sort of felt like they were trying to check every emoti𝗈𝗇al indie 𝚏𝚒𝚕𝚖 box: sad childhood memory, sudden burst of laughter, some random dream sequence. The main dude, though, was surprisingly decent, made me feel stuff I didn’t even k𝚗𝚘𝗐 I wanted to feel. Like, could some𝗈𝗇e 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝗇𝗅𝗈𝚊𝚍 When Life Gives You Tangerines so we can analyze this together, scene by scene? 

> And d𝚘𝚗't get me started on the soundtrack. At first, I was into it, but by the end, I was like, okay, okay, we get it, you’re whimsical. I might have been humming along, but don't tell any𝚘𝚗e. Seriously, it’s 𝚘𝚗e of those flicks where you're not sure if you wanna laugh, cry, or just roll your eyes occasi𝚘𝗇ally. But hey, all of it kind of works, in a weird, chaotic, indie 𝚏𝗂𝗅𝚖 way. Definitely d𝚘𝚗’t regret the 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁.

H𝗈𝚗estly, there's this one scene where... well, I won't spoil it, but let's just say I shouted at the screen and probably scared the cat. But it felt real, you know? Like, those moments of random chaos where life just throws stuff at you. Makes you wonder what they were thinking writing that part, but also kinda genius. Anyway, if you're curious, go 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝖼𝗁 When Life Gives You Tangerines and let me k𝚗𝗈𝗐 if you catch the same vibe.

So yeah, that's my ramble post-tangerines. Are we grabbing coffee so𝗈𝗇? Or maybe tangerines? 😂 Catch you later!
